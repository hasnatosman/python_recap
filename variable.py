Variable is kind of bucket where you can put anything.
in variable where you can put different types of value.

"""

a = 10
b = 20

"""
here, a and b are two variables. 10 and 20 are values.
'=' is a assignment operator.
"""
x = 10
print(x)
x = 20
print(x)
"""
we just assigned 10 in x, that means the value of x is 10.
but then we reassigned 20 as the value. so that means the value of any variable is
changeable.
"""

x0 = 10
x1 = 20
_x = 'Hasnat'


"""
We can use any of A to Z and also a to z, firstly using underscore(_), we can even put letter(a-z),
digit(0-9), but we can't use sign like(@,#,$,%,&) and mostly prohibited are python keywords.

Example: True, False, as, and, class, continue, pass and so on. 
"""

a = 10
A = 20
print(a, A)

x = 10
y = 20
print(x,y)

"""
variable and identifier are very case sensitive. A and a have different meanings and value as well.
Even using a single extra space will cause an error.
